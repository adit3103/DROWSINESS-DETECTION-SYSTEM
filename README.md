# Drowsiness Detection System

## Description
The Drowsiness Detection System is a microcontroller-based project aimed at improving road safety by monitoring driver fatigue in real-time. The system uses sensors to detect signs of drowsiness and generates alerts to warn the driver, reducing the likelihood of accidents caused by fatigue.

---

## Problem Statement
Driving while fatigued is a significant safety hazard. Drowsiness reduces focus and reaction time, increasing the risk of collisions. This project aims to develop an efficient system to identify driver fatigue indicators and provide timely alerts, ensuring safer driving conditions for all road users.
